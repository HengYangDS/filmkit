## Purpose

Prove the engine end to end with a short bilingual film that the repository carries, builds and verifies, and that the engine's tests load instead of any production film.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The sample film meets the owner's text and review bars

The sample film's text SHALL line up as the frame audit measures it, and its review configuration SHALL hold the overall score and every dimension at 95 or more.

#### Scenario: The sample's picture passes the text-layout measures

- **WHEN** `check-picture` audits either edition of the sample film
- **THEN** the frame audit reports no text-layout finding, and the closing checklist's items share one left edge beside their checks

#### Scenario: The sample's review floors

- **WHEN** the sample film's review configuration is read
- **THEN** its overall and dimension minimums are 95
