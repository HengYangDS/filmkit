## Purpose

Audit an edition's picture through all its speech, and keep a render from starting while a gated finding remains.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The frame audit measures how text lines up

The frame audit SHALL measure the settled names and marks of the content band in every voiced frame it exercises, and SHALL report per scene each text-layout defect that lasts 1 second or more, with its start, its end, its texts and its measured offsets.

#### Scenario: A row of names on two baselines

- **WHEN** two names of one size stand side by side through 2 seconds of speech with baselines 6 px apart
- **THEN** the audit reports one ragged row for that scene with its start, its end, both texts and both baselines

#### Scenario: A passing misalignment is not reported

- **WHEN** the two names stand on different baselines for half a second and then share one
- **THEN** the audit reports no ragged row

#### Scenario: Lines and columns that do not line up

- **WHEN** the lines of one left-aligned block start 5 px apart, or a line's ink stands 4 px below the ink of the line above it
- **THEN** the audit reports a ragged column or crammed lines for that scene with the texts and the offsets

#### Scenario: Measures that rest on estimated widths

- **WHEN** like marks stand at uneven pitch under names at equal gaps, or a name comes within 3 px of a mark's stroke
- **THEN** the audit reports an uneven pitch or a touching mark, measured on the stroke's points rather than its bounding box

#### Scenario: A heading at the top of a tall card

- **WHEN** a name stands at the top of a card more than three of its lines tall
- **THEN** the audit reports no card-centre finding for it

### Requirement: The picture gate refuses text that does not line up

`check-picture` SHALL refuse the text-layout findings that rest on exact anchors, sizes and baselines, `ragged_rows`, `ragged_columns`, `crammed_lines` and `off_card_centre`, and SHALL record `uneven_pitch` and `touching_marks` in the gate record without refusing them.

#### Scenario: A ragged row refuses

- **WHEN** the frame audit reports a ragged row
- **THEN** `check-picture` writes a refused record that names it and exits with a refusal

#### Scenario: An uneven pitch is recorded

- **WHEN** the frame audit reports an uneven pitch and no gated finding
- **THEN** `check-picture` writes a passing record that lists the uneven pitch
