# picture-gates Specification

## Purpose

Audit an edition's picture through all its speech, and keep a render from starting while a gated finding remains.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The frame audit measures balance and cover through speech

The frame audit SHALL measure, in every voiced frame it exercises, the box around every lit mark and legible name in the content band. It SHALL report per scene each run of 2 seconds or more of speech in which that box stands more than 12% of the frame's width or height off the content centre, or covers less than a tenth of the content band, with the run's start, end and worst value.

#### Scenario: A picture that stands off centre through a thought

- **WHEN** a scene's lit picture stands 13% above the content centre through 2.5 seconds of speech
- **THEN** the audit reports one off-centre run for that scene with its start, its end and its largest offset

#### Scenario: A brief excursion is not a run

- **WHEN** the lit picture stands 13% off for 1.5 seconds of speech and then returns within 12%
- **THEN** the audit reports no off-centre run

#### Scenario: Quiet does not count

- **WHEN** the lit picture covers less than a tenth of the band only while no one speaks
- **THEN** the audit reports no thin run

### Requirement: An edition's picture is checked before it renders

`check-picture` SHALL run the frame audit over every frame of the edition's timeline at one thirtieth of a second, the sync audit on that audit's trace and marks, and the motion audit at 30 frames per second, on the current composition and timeline. It SHALL write a gate record naming the composition's and the timeline's SHA-256, the engine version, each audit's report and every gated finding, and SHALL refuse when a gated finding exists.

#### Scenario: A clean picture passes

- **WHEN** no audit reports a gated finding
- **THEN** `check-picture` writes a passing record and exits 0

#### Scenario: A gated finding refuses

- **WHEN** the frame audit reports an overlap or an off-centre run
- **THEN** `check-picture` writes a refused record, names each gated finding and exits with a refusal

### Requirement: A render waits for a passing gate record

`render-picture` SHALL refuse an edition before it starts the renderer unless the edition's gate record passed and names the current composition's and timeline's SHA-256 and the running engine version.

#### Scenario: The composition changed after its check

- **WHEN** `picture/film.js` changed after `check-picture` passed
- **THEN** `render-picture` refuses and names `check-picture` as the step to run again

#### Scenario: An edition that was never checked

- **WHEN** the edition has no gate record
- **THEN** `render-picture` refuses before the renderer starts
